Sample Random user Profile page using VueJS CDN

The random user generator API (https://randomuser.me/api) is the API in use for this project but can be replaced with the one generated by the API application when its running

Modify the Line const res = await fetch('https://randomuser.me/api') in the app.js file and replace with the necessary API
